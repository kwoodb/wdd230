            <h3><a href="https://www.target.com/">TARGET</a></h3>

            <p>Target.com uses <strong>contrast</strong> to create visual interest in their website design through color 
            and through the size/weight of the typeface. Target is known for its use of contrasting colors red and 
            white; however, the company also employed grey and black to create additional contrast. The screenshot 
            of Target’s homepages demonstrates how the company also uses size and weight in the text to create a 
            contrast that causes visual hierarchy.</p>

            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://www.ancestry.com">ANCESTRY</a></h3>
            <img src="images/ancestryscreenshot.jpg" alt="Mobile view secreenshot of Ancestry.com's homepage">
            <p>Ancestry.com utilizes <strong>visual hierarchy</strong> through size and color. In the above 
            screenshot, the eye is immediately drawn to the largest text, “Every family has a story.” Next 
            the eye is drawn to the bright green CTA button. The eye continues from text to images, until it 
            finally rests. Visual hierarchy was enabled through the use of contrast and whitespace.  </p>

            <h2>White Space</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://www.zillow.com">ZILLOW</a></h3>
            <img src="images/zillowscreenshot.jpg" alt="Mobile view secreenshot of Zillow.com's homepage">
            <p>Zillow does an excellent job using <strong>white space</strong> and <strong>clean design</strong>. 
            The page is kept simple so that the user is not distracted. The body copy was strategically placed 
            with center alignment to create visual whitespace around the text. Additionally, the tagline was placed 
            in the whitespace of the background image. This allowed the text to not compete with the image. </p>
